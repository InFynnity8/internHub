       <h3>Refund & Cancellation Policy </h3>
<p>Before the start of the batch of their choice, a user may ask for a refund at any moment. After deducting a transaction processing fee of
20% of the training fee paid by the user, the remaining amount will be returned within 15 working days (Monday through Friday, except
for national holidays) after the user makes the refund request. However, no refund would be allowed once the customer had paid and
accessed the training materials. </p>
<br>
<p>For Intern hub student Basic, no refund/cancellation would be permitted after payment. </p>
<br>
<p> For Intern hub student Standard, no refund/cancellation would be permitted after payment. </p>
<br>
<p> For Intern hub Student Premium, no refund/cancellation would be permitted after payment. </p>
<br>

<p>No refunds or cancellations are allowed for advertisers who place advertisements for their goods, services, and offerings on
various Intern hub channels (website, newsletter, Facebook page, other social media channels, etc.) once the advertising
campaign has started or the payment has been received, whichever comes first. The advertiser would be entitled to a pro-rata
refund if Intern hub terminated an advertising campaign owing to internal policies (after deducting the amount for the deliverables already
served). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event of a conflict, the specific terms and conditions stated on each product
and service page and/or as agreed upon with a user before, during, or after the transaction shall prevail. </p>
<br>
<p>We reserve the right to periodically modify the terms and conditions that apply to our products, services, and related agreements
(including those that govern returns and cancellations). Before making a purchase, you are recommended to review the most recent terms
and conditions on this page as well as any connected product or service-specific terms and conditions page.</p>
