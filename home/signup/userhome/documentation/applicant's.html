        <h3>Applicants' Most Important Terms & Conditions </h3>
        <p>These terms are in addition to the other general terms and conditions that are stated on the page and that you must read because they
        apply to all users of the website. These terms are specifically for applicants. If a candidate violates these T&Cs, Intern Hub may take
        appropriate legal action against him or her, among other things by rejecting his or her application for an internship and/or permanently
        blocking the account.</p>
        <br>
        <p>You have 72 hours to reply to any communications from Intern Hub or the employer regarding your application if you have applied for an
        internship opportunity there. </p>
        <br>
        <p>You must use every effort to join and begin the internship on schedule once you've accepted an offer. Lack of attendance, a last-minute
        rejection of an earlier accepted internship offer or going incommunicado all reflect poorly on you in the eyes of the Employer and
        undermine the credibility of the applicant pool as a whole. If you engage in such behavior, we will block your account on Intern Hub and,
        if necessary, report it to the college authorities. </p>
        <br>
        <p> Any misrepresentation of information, hiding of relevant information, or impersonation would result in your account being blocked on the
        website and, where appropriate, you being reported to your college administration. You must provide accurate and complete information
        when applying for an internship or creating an account on Intern hub. </p>
        <br> 
        <p> Before applying for an internship, you must carefully consider all of its requirements (profile, location, compensation, required abilities, etc.).
        Inappropriate applications will result in a penalty on your account (we may stop you from applying to future internship opportunities or
        block your account altogether) </p>
        <br>
        <p>You are not allowed to give, sell, or share any of the Employers' data (contact information, etc.), either for free or for money, with any other
        organization. Any such effort would result in the permanent blocking of your Intern Hub account and the possibility of legal action being
        taken against you. </p>
        <br>
        <p>You must uphold the community's standards and decorum because the Intern Hub community is made up of sincere users who are known
        for and expected to exhibit high standards of professionalism in their interactions with other users and Employers. </p>
        <p>Your email correspondence with other Intern Hub members should always be professional and free of any vulgar or derogatory language. </p>
        <br>
        <p>You agree to have gone through the â€˜Safety Tips for Applicants' section of these Terms and have understood the same. </p>
        <br>
        <p> While we make every effort to give you accurate and trustworthy information about internships, mistakes can still happen. Therefore, before
        beginning an internship, you must do your due diligence and research on a company or organization and assume full responsibility for
        the same. You additionally acknowledge that you have read, comprehended, and specifically agreed to the "Disclaimers"
        part of these Terms. </p>
        <br>
        <p>It is both your duty and your obligation to notify the Intern hub right away if you notice any questionable activity, content, or behavior on
        the Intern hub by an Employer or another user so that the appropriate action can be done. </p>
        <br>
        <p>While we make our best efforts to bring you the best internship opportunities possible, Intern hub does not guarantee an internship to a
        student. </p>
        <br>
        <p> Upon registration, your registered email id and phone number will be automatically subscribed to receive email and SMS notifications from
        the Intern hub. You may opt-out of it anytime. </p>
